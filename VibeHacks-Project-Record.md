# VibeHacks Project Record

## Project Overview

VibeHacks is a spatial computing development platform consisting of two independent projects that enable bidirectional conversation synchronization between VS Code and visionOS applications.

### Core Components

- **Roo-Code**: VS Code extension with VisionSync service for real-time conversation synchronization
- **JoyVibe**: visionOS application providing spatial AI conversation interface

## Current Status

### Completed Features

- **Brand Migration**: Complete transition from Zed to Roo Code branding
- **VisionSync Service**: WebSocket and discovery servers with automatic service discovery via Bonjour/mDNS
- **Protocol Compatibility**: Fixed handshake protocol for seamless client-server communication
- **UI Optimization**: Streamlined VisionSync settings panel with reduced configuration complexity
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Real-time conversation synchronization between platforms
- **Connection Management**: Robust error handling, reconnection logic, and status feedback

### Technical Architecture

- **Communication Protocol**: WebSocket-based with JSON message format
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic discovery using mDNS/Bonjour
- **Message Types**: ClientHandshake, ConnectionAccepted, AIConversation, TriggerSend, Ping/Pong
- **Platform Support**: macOS (VS Code) and visionOS (JoyVibe)

## Project Structure

### Roo-Code (VS Code Extension)

- **VisionSync Service**: Core synchronization service with WebSocket server
- **Settings Panel**: Streamlined UI for service management
- **AI Bridge**: Integration with VS Code conversation system
- **Network Utils**: Service discovery and connection management

### JoyVibe (visionOS Application)

- **AI Agents Interface**: Spatial conversation UI optimized for visionOS
- **Connection Manager**: Automatic service discovery and connection handling
- **Message Sync**: Real-time bidirectional message synchronization
- **Service Integration**: Compatible with Roo-Code VisionSync protocol

## Development History

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

- Established basic WebSocket communication
- Implemented service discovery mechanism
- Created dual-platform architecture

### Phase 2: Integration (Completed)

- Developed VisionSync service infrastructure
- Fixed protocol compatibility issues
- Implemented bidirectional conversation sync

### Phase 3: Optimization (Completed)

- Streamlined user interface design
- Removed unnecessary configuration complexity
- Enhanced connection reliability

### Phase 4: Brand Migration (Completed)

- Complete rebranding from Zed to Roo Code
- Updated all UI text and code references
- Fixed protocol compatibility for new branding

## Technical Specifications

### Communication Protocol

- **Transport**: WebSocket over TCP
- **Discovery**: mDNS service advertisement
- **Message Format**: JSON with timestamp and ID fields
- **Handshake**: ClientHandshake â†’ ConnectionAccepted flow
- **Capabilities**: AI conversation synchronization

### Service Configuration

- **WebSocket Port**: 8765 (configurable)
- **Discovery Port**: 8766 (configurable)
- **Service Name**: "Roo Code" (mDNS advertisement)
- **Connection Limit**: Configurable maximum connections

### Message Types

- **ClientHandshake**: Initial connection establishment
- **ConnectionAccepted/Rejected**: Connection response
- **AIConversation**: Conversation message synchronization
- **TriggerSend**: Action trigger messages
- **Ping/Pong**: Connection health monitoring

## Current Deployment Status

### Roo-Code

- **Local Status**: Committed to feature branch (feat/vision-sync-integration)
- **GitHub Status**: Pending (blocked by TypeScript type errors)
- **Functionality**: Complete and operational

### JoyVibe

- **Local Status**: Committed and pushed to main branch
- **GitHub Status**: Successfully deployed
- **Functionality**: Complete and operational

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

- **Multi-client Support**: Support for multiple simultaneous visionOS connections
- **Advanced AI Features**: Integration with additional AI capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced message processing efficiency
- **Security Features**: Authentication and encryption for production use

### Maintenance Requirements

- **Protocol Evolution**: Maintain backward compatibility for protocol updates
- **Platform Updates**: Adapt to VS Code and visionOS platform changes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track connection reliability and message latency

## Technical Debt

### Roo-Code TypeScript Issues

- **Type Import/Export**: Inconsistent type definitions for VisionMessageType and VisionServiceEvent
- **EventEmitter Types**: Generic type definition mismatches
- **Message Validation**: Type safety improvements needed

### Resolution Priority

- **High**: Fix TypeScript errors to enable GitHub deployment
- **Medium**: Enhance error handling and logging
- **Low**: Code organization and documentation improvements

## Success Metrics

### Functional Criteria

- **Connection Reliability**: Stable WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection
- **Message Synchronization**: Real-time bidirectional conversation sync
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic detection and connection establishment
- **User Experience**: Streamlined configuration and operation

### Performance Criteria

- **Connection Time**: Sub-second service discovery and connection
- **Message Latency**: Near real-time message synchronization
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal impact on host applications
- **Stability**: Robust operation under various network conditions

## Project Completion

The VibeHacks project has successfully achieved its core objectives of creating a bidirectional conversation synchronization system between VS Code and visionOS platforms. Both applications are functional and provide the intended spatial computing development experience.
